# Run the program
vacuum_world()


Output
Enter Location of Vacuum (A or B): A
Enter status of A (0 for Clean, 1 for Dirty): 1
Enter status of B (0 for Clean, 1 for Dirty): 1

Initial Location Condition:
A: Dirty
B: Dirty

Vacuum is placed in Location A.
Location A is Dirty.
Sucking dirt... Location A has been cleaned.
Location B is Dirty.
Moving RIGHT to Location B.
Sucking dirt... Location B has been cleaned.

GOAL STATE:  {'A': '0', 'B': '0'}
Performance Measurement (Total cost): 3
